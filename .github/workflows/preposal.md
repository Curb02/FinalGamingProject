# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Im Thinking about making a 3d game in unity engine, where i'll either program the game in C# or use pluggins to have a python editor in my game and program in unity via python. I'm currently between doing a game similar to angry birds but in a 3d and more open world style, and a 3d adventure style game(leaning towards idea 1 though).

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A-working on my own

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I've been looking into using python editer plugins for unity, so I'm wondering if i decide to go with that route in my game for unity using the python editor that it's all good with you.
