# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Topple(not to be confused with the board game but this is the working title)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My Project is a 3d version of angry birds using a cannon and blocks in Unity Engine.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My plan for my project aka the Topple game, is to combine the concept of angry birds with the 3d world via the Unity gaming engine. In the game the player will have accsess to a cannon which they can use to shoot cannon balls with potentially diffrent abilities(similar to the birds in angry birds), at a generated strucutre which will be on a platform. The player's goal is to hit off all blocks making up the strucutre off the platform/enough so that they're considered to be out. Then based on the number of shots it takes the player will get points/stars before they move on to the next generated strucutre(level). In essence my game for Topple is going to combine my knowledge of python, Unity Engine, and physics to make a 3d inspired version of angry birds.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what i want to accmoplish in Topple is for the cannon to able to shoot cannon balls at the generated block strucutres, the code to generate those objects/structures, and the code to tell whether a block is succesfully knocked off.
List Summarizing: Cannon, cannonball, generating strutures, block knock off code, point counter

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

List: Cannon, cannonball, diffrent types of cannon balls with diffrent effects(normal,acid,mini etc), generating structures, point counter, block knock off code.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

List: Cannon(maybe diffrent types), cannonball, diffrent types of cannon balls with diffrent effects(normal,acid,mini etc), generating structures, challenge structures code, strucutres made out of diffrent shapes like cylinders or sphere not just cubes, point counter, block knock off code, seemless transitioning between challanges or levels.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to complete all of the steps in my python final project game Topple. I'm going to need to focus on reaserching and learning 3 key things: Github, Unity Engine(Aspects of C# code as well as python editor pluggins), and finally more aspects of python code. While learning github will probably be the easiest considering i just need to learn the interface more. 

Meanwhile, i already know python very well so if I'm succesfull with using a python editor in python for topple i can really on my knowledge in python that i already have and will develop. Finally, i also need to learn learn how to work the actual Unity3d game engine which i have already started so that i can properly code and navigate the platform. I'll do this by taking the junior programmer and Intro to Unity learning courses on the website and watching youtube videos, so that i can learn C#(will still aim to program the game in python) on the side and also the aspects of the Unity engine.
