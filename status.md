Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have Completed the player movement for the turret, as well as level 1 out of 3 in the game, the collision and explosison effects, the code for the wall generation in level 1, the actual projectile and have imported some asset packages i can use to add more decoration/bonus stars model that can be hit for points.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to get the counter code done so that a level can be considered completed and then go to the next scene/level, the title scene, pyramid of blocks as an obstable for level 2/3, and another obstable to deal with, and finally some decorations and potentially more projecticle types if i have time.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far it's just been getting used to Unity's interface which has had the tendency of being a bit of a pain to deal with, thankfully doing work in vscode coding wise is making it easier
